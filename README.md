# Hello, I'm Andrea! 👋

🦊 This profile is a collection of my projects!<br>
💻 I'm interested in cybersecurity, language and grammar analysis and algorithms and data structures (but also in web development).<br>
📚 My favourite languages are C, Rust, Java and Haskell but I also develop in Javascript/HTML/CSS, Python and sometimes in Kotlin.
