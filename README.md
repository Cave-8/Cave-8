# Hello, I'm Andrea! ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ¦Š This profile is a collection of my projects!<br>
ğŸ’» I'm interested in cybersecurity, language and grammar analysis and algorithms and data structures (but also in web development).<br>
ğŸ“š My favourite languages are C, Rust, Haskell and Python but I like to experiment in many languages.
